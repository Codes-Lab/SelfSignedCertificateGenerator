# Self-Signed Certificate Generator

The Self-Signed Certificate Generator is a Java application that allows you to generate a self-signed X.509 certificate and corresponding private key using the Java security API and Bouncy Castle provider. This is useful for testing and development purposes when you need to create a self-signed certificate for SSL/TLS encryption.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Bouncy Castle Provider Library (bcprov-jdk15on-1.69.jar)

## Usage

1. Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) if you don't have it already.
2. Download the Bouncy Castle Provider Library (`bcprov-jdk15on-1.69.jar`) from the [Bouncy Castle website](https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html) and add it to your classpath.
3. Compile the Java source file `SelfSignedCertificateGenerator.java`:
   ```shell
   javac SelfSignedCertificateGenerator.java
   ```
4. Run the `SelfSignedCertificateGenerator` class to generate the self-signed certificate and private key:
   ```shell
   java SelfSignedCertificateGenerator
   ```
5. The application will generate a self-signed X.509 certificate (`certificate.cert`) and the corresponding private key (`key.pem`) in the current directory.

## Configuration

Modify the following parameters in the `SelfSignedCertificateGenerator` class if needed:

- `keySize`: The key size used for generating the RSA key pair. The default is 2048 bits.
- `validityDays`: The number of days the generated certificate will be valid. The default is 365 days.
- `certificateFileName`: The name of the output file for the generated certificate. The default is `certificate.cert`.
- `privateKeyFileName`: The name of the output file for the generated private key. The default is `key.pem`.

## Important Note

The self-signed certificate generated by this tool is not issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA) and should not be used in a production environment. It is intended for testing and development purposes only.
